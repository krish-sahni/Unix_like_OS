# Unix_like_OS

A custom-built Unix-like operating system, designed for RISC-V embedded systems, featuring virtual memory management, system calls, ELF file execution, and preemptive multitasking.

## Overview
This project implements a Unix-like OS from scratch, capable of running on RISC-V architecture. The operating system includes:
- A custom file system
- Process management with multitasking
- Virtual memory control using the Sv39 paging standard
- System call handling
- ELF file loading and execution
- Memory-mapped I/O for hardware interaction

## Features
16-bit virtual memory system using paging (Sv39)  
Preemptive multitasking with process scheduling  
File system abstraction for efficient I/O  
Support for ELF binaries (Executable and Linkable Format)  
Minimal kernel with system call interface
